/*! This function returns the vector of \a Objects found in \a
 scan. It proceeds through the following steps:

 1. Removal of ghosting artifacts. We assume point cloud is coming
 from Hokuyo scanner, which produces artifacts. This step uses \a
 SmartScan::removeGrazingPoints(...) to eliminate these.

2. Table detection. We assume that a) the object all lie on a planar
surface such as a table; b) the scan has been pre-cropped so that the
table is the dominant plane in the scan (no walls, floors etc). This
step detects the dominant plane in the scan and then removes it.

3. Decompose scan into connected components. Once the table has been
removed, the connected components that are left should be the objects
we are interested in. Of course, we might still have stuff under the
table or way above - in future work we will also do more cropping here
based on the detected table.

4. Discard potential objects that do not have enough points to be
considered reliable.

5. Compute controids and principal axes for what's left, using \a
SmartScan::principalAxes(...)

One potential problem is that this does not leave the scan untouched
(it has to remove things). Maybe in the future we'll also write a
version that takes in a \a const \a SmartScan at the price of a couple
of extra copies.
