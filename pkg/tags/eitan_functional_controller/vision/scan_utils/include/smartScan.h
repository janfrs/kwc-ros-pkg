/*!
  This class holds most of the functionality of the Scan_Utils library.

  A SmartScan is essentially a point cloud which can apply a number of
  tools on itself (or other clouds). It holds the 3D vertex list which
  defines the cloud, but in order to apply various tools it might need
  more data or the same data in different formats. It will either
  create that for itself, or require it to be supplied.

  Intensity data is not stored or used in any way, for the
  moment. Serialization functions assume its existance to make it
  easier to load data saved by other tools, but it is not stored at
  all after it is read.
  
  The original point cloud (referred to here as the "native" data is
  held in a ROS compatible format. This is so that in the future, if a
  new cloud is received over the ROS message system, we can store it
  directly without requiring an extra copy. However, this
  functionality is not implemented for now.

  Since most tools provided by this library are from VTK, this class
  also holds a copy of the point cloud in VTK format. This includes both a
  list of vertices and a populated spatial search structure similar to
  a kd-tree. The external user does not need to know about the VTK
  version of the data; it is the job of all public functions of this
  class to ensure that the VTK data is created when needed and then
  kept up to date when the "native" data is modified.
