<description brief="A simple library to load image files as SDL surfaces">

The SDL_image library can load images of various formats as SDL surfaces.
This library supports BMP, PNM (PPM/PGM/PBM), XBM, LBM, PCX, GIF, JPEG, PNG,
TGA, and TIFF formats.

This ROS package is just a wrapper for the standard SDL_image distribution, to
allow automatic installation using ROS dependency generation. It does not
change the SDL_image library in any way. Any specific questions about broken
automatic ROS build scripts should be directed at the ROS package maintainer
not the SDL_image authors.
