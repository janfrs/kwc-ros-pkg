  A generic multiplexer; it can take a bunch of arbitrary-typed nodes and
  multiplex between them. Useful anywhere a mux is useful in circuits or HDL...
  as one example, deciding which algorithm gets control of the drive system of
  the robot. You only want one algorithm to drive the robot at any time, and
  need a nice way to switch between who is actually passing messages to
  the robot and whose messages are getting ignored.
