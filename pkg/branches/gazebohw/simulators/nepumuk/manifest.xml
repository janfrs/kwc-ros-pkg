  <description brief="The ROSified Nepumuk simulator from libsunflower.sourceforge.net">
    Nepumuk is a simple kinematic 2D simulator for robots with some
    simple sensors. It was originally developed to test the
    libsunflower code and has been later used as integration sandbox
    in some other mobile robotics projects.
