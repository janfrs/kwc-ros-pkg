# The starting state for the robot. This is eth complete state of the
# robot, all joint values, everything that needs to be specified to
# completely define where each part of the robot is in space. The
# meaning for each element in the state vector can be extracted from
# viewing the output of the robot model construction (the kinematic
# model constructed from the parsed URDF model) in verbose mode
robot_msgs/KinematicState start_state


# The goal state for the model to plan for. The state is not explicit.
# The goal is considered achieved if all the constraints are satisfied.
robot_msgs/PoseConstraint[] goal_constraints


# No state in the produced motion plan will violate these constraints
robot_msgs/KinematicConstraints constraints


# The number of times this plan is to be computed. Shortest solution
# will be reported.
int32 times

# Boolean flag: if true, the returned path will contain interpolated
# states as well
byte interpolate

# The maximum amount of time the motion planner is allowed to plan for
float64 allowed_time

# The result of a motion plan: a kinematic path. If the motion plan is
# not succesful, this path has 0 states. If the motion plan is
# succesful, this path contains the minimum number of states (but it
# includes start and goal states) to define the motions for the
# robot. If more intermediate states are needed, linear interpolation
# is to be assumed.
robot_msgs/KinematicPath path


# The threshold that was actually achieved. If the planner did not have enough time,
# it may return a distance larger than the desired threshold. The user may choose to 
# discard the path
