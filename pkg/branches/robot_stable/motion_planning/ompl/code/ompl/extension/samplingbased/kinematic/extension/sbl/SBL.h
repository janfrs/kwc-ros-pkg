       @subsubsection SBL Single-query Bi-directional Lazy collision checking planner (SBL)
       
       @par Short description
       
       SBL is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to grow two
       trees at once: one grows from the starting state and the other
       from the goal state. Attempts are made to connect these trees
       at every step of the expansion. If they are connected, a
       solution path is obtained. However, this solution path is not
       certain to be valid (the lazy part of the algorithm) so it is
       checked for validity. If invalid parts are found, they are
       removed from the tree and exploration of the state space
       continues until a solution is found. 

       To guide the exploration, and additional grid data structure is
       maintained. Grid cells contain states that have been previously
       visited. When deciding which state to use for further
       expansion, this grid is used and least filled grid cells have
       most chances of being selected. The grid is usually imposed on
       a projection of the state space. This projection needs to be
       set before using the planner.
