<description brief="WxMpl">
WxMpl is a library of wxPython widgets which provide interactive
plotting capabilities via the matplotlib 2D plotting library. Although
matplotlib excels at generating a variety of publication quality
figures, its wxPython widgetry compares poorly with BLT's interactive
features. WxMpl aims to remedy this situation by providing
out-of-the-box support for basic user interactions while supporting as
many of matplotlib's figures and features as possible.
