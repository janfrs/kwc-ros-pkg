  (:documentation "Contains the dependency graph ADT.  A dependency graph represents a computational node with a set of variables, some of which are externally set, and others of which the node is responsible for keeping up-to-date.  You can also have multiple communicating dependency graphs.  This implemented by tying external variables of one graph to variables of another graph."))
