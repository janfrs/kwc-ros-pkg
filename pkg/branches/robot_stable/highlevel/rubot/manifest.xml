  A rubot is a ruby-controlled abstract robot. The concept is just to have a
  few dumb ruby files for scripting lower-level (not necessarily simple)
  actions together to make demos. For example, "drive to XY, then open the door
  in front of you, then drive to another XY." This is not trying to compete
  with more sophisticated algorithsm like TR or whatever; it's just a way to 
  slap together a few actions to show them off for a demo.
