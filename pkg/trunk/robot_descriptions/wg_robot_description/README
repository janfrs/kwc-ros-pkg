Willow Garage XML Robot Descriptions
=======================================================================
This directory contains a list of robot descriptions in the format
specified by Willow Garage.  For details on formatting, please see:

  http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/RobotDescriptionFormat

Be advised the code is still the most up-to-date documentation.

  pr2.xml contains the master PR2 robot description.  All kinematic
and dynamics users should refer to this document for information and
naming conventions.

  controller_test.xml contains the most up-to-date controller xml file
for the entire robot.  Controller designers should refer to this xml
file for creating controller architectures.

  actuator_test.xml contains the most up-to-date xml file for the
complete list of actuators in the PR2 robot.  This list should reflect
actual hardware components for the PR2 robot.

  transmission_test.xml contains the most up-to-date transmission
descriptions for the PR2 robot.  This list describes how joints
described in pr2.xml are related to actuators in actuator_test.xml.

  The current parser for the robot description files is located in

     ros-pkg/robot_descriptions/wg_robot_description_parser

The parser (URDF) reads the xml file and fills in corresponding predefined
data structures for a robot configuration.  A separate custom parser
exists in 

     ros-pkg/robot_descriptions/gazebo_robot_description

for making a valid pr2 model file (pr2_xml.model) for Gazebo's
consumption.
