Willow Garage XML Robot Descriptions
=======================================================================
This directory contains a list of robot descriptions in the format
specified by Willow Garage.  For details on formatting, please see:

  http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/RobotDescriptionFormat

Be advised the code is still the most up-to-date documentation.

  pr2.xml contains the master PR2 robot description.  All kinematic
and dynamics users should refer to this document for information and
naming conventions.

  controllers.xml should contain the most up-to-date controller xml file
for the entire robot.  Controller designers should refer to this xml
file for creating controller architectures.  motor_tests directory
contains xml files for testing simple motor setups (e.g. etherCAT tests).

  actuators.xml should contain the most up-to-date xml file for the
complete list of actuators in the PR2 robot.  This list should reflect
actual hardware components for the PR2 robot.

  transmissions.xml should contain the most up-to-date transmission
descriptions for the PR2 robot.  This list describes how joints
described in pr2.xml are related to actuators in actuators.xml.

  The current parser for the robot description files is located in

     ros-pkg/robot_descriptions/wg_robot_description_parser

The parser (URDF) reads the xml file and fills in corresponding predefined
data structures for robot configurations.  An additional custom parser
exists in 

     ros-pkg/robot_descriptions/gazebo_robot_description

for making a valid pr2 model file (pr2_xml.model) for Gazebo's
consumption.
