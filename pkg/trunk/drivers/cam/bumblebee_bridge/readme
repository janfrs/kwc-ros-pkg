this is an interim hack of a stopgap measure. we have some bumblebee cameras
that I really have to use for a demo next week. I don't have ROS fully working
on Windows yet. Thus I have written a silly XML-RPC server that runs on a
Windows box with a Bumblebee3 connected to it. This directory contains a
ROS node which connects to the botnet and waits for a service request for a
stereo image. When it gets a request, it fires off a (nested) request to my
XML-RPC bumblebee service running on a windows box. The response is forwarded
along. Yes, it's a total hack. Until Point Grey decides Linux is worth
supporting, we'll continue to have to jump through such hoops (or, more likely,
use cameras from Videre or someone else who actually provides Linux drivers).
Since the Bumblebee3 doesn't show up as a libdc1394-compatible device (unless
I'm doing something horribly wrong), there is no way to make it work in Linux
without a driver from Point Grey.
