  <description brief="A standalone hokuyo driver">
    A standalone driver for the UTM-30LX pulled from player distribution and
    modified heavily.  It is isolated in its own package since it must
    be licensed under the LGPL.  Eventually this may be merged back
    with player, at which point this package would likely be removed.
