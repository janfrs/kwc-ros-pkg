@b tf is a library for keeping track of coordinate frames.  

@section summary Summary
The tf library has a core library which keeps track of coordinate frames independent 
of ROS integration.  The library 
utilizes the Linear Math libraires from the Bullet Physics engine.  And there are 
classes which provide simple interfaces to ROS.  

The major interface to the tf library is through the tf::Transformer class.  This class
provides all the necessary external interfaces.  

However for the common use cases in a distributed ROS environment the Transformer class
is subclassed to provide automated messaging to keep up to date on transforms.  
The tf::TransformListener class will automatically listen for transform messages sent over ROS and 
insert them into the libraries storage.  There is a similar helper class the tf::TransformBroadcaster
which provides a simple interface for broadcasting transforms onto the ROS network.  

@section library Library
There is a ROS messaging independant library encompased in the tf::Transformer class.  

@subsection storage Storage
Transforms are 
expressed as a combination of a translation and rotation in 3D space, in the form of a tf::Vector3 and a 
tf::Quaternion.  Each transform has an associated frame id, parent id, and time stamp.  Each transform added
to the library is pushed into a list sorted by time for each frame id.  

@subsection lookup Transform Composition
To generate a transform between two arbitrary frames the structure of the relationship between the frames is
assumed to be a tree.  To find the spanning set between any two frames the library will start by recursively finding
the parent of both the target frame and the source frame.  These will both end at the root of the tree.  
Then the library will step back down the tree removing all but the closest common parent.  

@subsection timetransform Transforms in Time
The above transform often provides adaquate functionality to perform transforms between any two frames at the 
time the data was collected.  However often it is useful to know where an object is in relation to something 
at a different time.  However this requires knowldege of which frame the object was stationary compared to during
the time interval.  A very common example is an object observed as a vehicle is driving.  Two seconds later as the 
vehicle approaches the obstacle where the object is in relation to the vehicle is good to know.  The map or odometery 
frame use for navigation would be a good fixed frame.  However if say the vehicle had a robotic hand which grabbed the 
object.  Two seconds later the object would be in the same position with relation to the hand, and and not the vehicle, 
so the fixed frame would be hand.  And the lookup would show the position of the object in the body frame the same short 
distance from the hand as observed when picked up, but the position of the hand may have changed relative to the body in 
the two seconds, to which this would be robust.  

@subsection exceptions Exceptions
Exceptions are thrown for bad lookup requiests and malformed trees.  The exceptions all derive from tf::TransformException
which is a derivative of std::RuntimeError and have the method what() defined for debugging.  
The specific exception classes are tf::LookupException tf::MaxDepthException and tf::ConnectivityException.  

Due to the importance of timing there is also an tf::ExtrapolationException which is thrown in the case that 
the time requested is too far from data currently stored in the library.  There are two common cases when this would 
happen.  If requests are made of the transform library faster than new transforms are added it will complain.  And the 
other case if is the requested time is too far in the past to be in the list of transforms stored.  The amount of extrapolation
and how long to keep data can be set in the tf::Transformer constructor.  

@subsection computation Computation
The library does not have any built in processing.  The lists are maintained by the inserting funciton call. 
The maintenance simply prunes expired transforms from the end of the list.  All transforms are generated 
when requested.  All interfaces use the std::string form of the frame id, however when storing the transforms 
the string is mapped to a number to allow internal computations to avoid strings.  

@section usage Common Usage
For most use cases the basic library will not be used directly.  

There are two helper classes to provide sending and recieving of ROS transform
messages.  tf::TransformBroadcaster and tf::TransformListener. 

@subsection listener TransformListener
The tf::TransformListener class inherits from tf::Transformer to provide all the functionality of the 
basic library.  In addition it also provides methods to directly transform ROS messages.  
And the third part of what it does is to automatically listen for and push transforms broadcast
on ROS into the library.  

@subsection broadcaster TransformBroadcaster
The tf::TransformBroadcaster class is the complement to the listener class.  The broadcaster class provides a 
simple API for broadcasting coordinate frame transforms.  

@subsection send_transform send_transform
When fixed offsets are built into the system the simplest way to add the 
transform to the system is to use the command send_transform.  It's a one
line command which will repeatedly publish the transform over ROS messages.  



@subsection datatypes Data Types used in tf
- Quaternion typedef of btQuaternion
- Vector3  typedef of btVector3
- Point  typedef of btVector3
- Transform  typedef of btTransform
- Pose  typedef of btTransform

-Stamped version of all of the above inherits from the data type and also has:
 - ros::Time stamp_
 - std::string frame_id_
 - std::string parent_frame_id_  (only used for Stamped<Transform> )

- There are analogous ROS messages in std_msgs to the Stamped data types.  

- Time represented by ros::Time and ros::Duration in ros/time.h in roscpp 



@section faq FAQ
 - How can tf be used in a 3D mapping framework? The very simple example that I had in mind for the past few days was the following: given 4 sensing devices: 1 Hokuyo, 1 SwissRanger SR4000, 1 Videre STOC and 1 Thermal FLIR camera.  The first 3 produce point clouds, and the last 3, images. After calibration, you get the necessary rotation matrices that you need to use to transform the SwissRanger point cloud into the left camera on the STOC, respectively the thermal image into left STOC, etc.   While collecting data, you constantly need to apply these rotation matrices to the point clouds generated by some sensors, to annotate your 3D points with texture (RGB), thermal information, etc

This is exactly where you want to use TransformListener.  The point cloud aggregator will be recieving messages over ROS from all of the sensors, 
in their respective date types.  However for example, say the Hokuyo is mounted on the base, and the videre is on the head and the swiss ranger 
is on the left arm.  The aggregating process has no idea where all these coordinate frames actually are in space.  
However the mechanims control process knows where the head and arms are in relationship to the base.  
And the localization process knows where the base is in relationship to the world.  Now if they are all 
publishing transforms using their own broadcaster instances.  All the aggregator node needs to do is 
instantiate the TransformListener and it will be able to relate the data from the videre to the data 
from the hokuyo and data from the swiss ranger.  The TransformListener class will extract all that information 
from the ROS network and provide it automatically to the Transformer base class.  The Transformer class then can provide 
the aggregator with any transform they wish.  The goal is that the end user doesn't have to worry about collecting any 
transforms, and they are automatically cached in time and can provide interpolated or extrapolated results if desired.
The way to make this easy for the  the developer/user is the use of frame ids.  The frame id's are simply strings which 
uniquely identify coordinate frames.  When the system is operating, if you have a point cloud arrive from the videre 
it will be in the "videre_camera_frame"  to use it in whatever frame you want simply transform 
it to the frame id of the frame you want and use it.

 - 

 - Can I transform a Point Cloud?  

Yes it's in tf package right now it will be moving to a point cloud package soon.  

 - Can I transform a laser scan into a point cloud in a different frame?  
Yes see the laser_scan package.  

 - Would it be possible to bring back into tf a method a-la  setWithMatrix () ? Are there any disadvantages (other than re-exposing NEWMAT) on doing that ?

I would suggest you take a look at the bullet data types.  The btTransform can be constructed using a btQuaternion and a btVector3, or a btMatrix and a btVector3.  And a btMatrix3x3 will take 9 values in it's constructor. Thus you can do tf_instance.setTransform(Stamped<tf::Transform>(tf::Transform(btMatrix3x3(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), btVector3(x,y,z)), ros::Time().fromSec(timestamp), "frame id", "parent id"));

 - I already have my own classes for converting to/from all 4 major representations (euler, axis-angle, rotation matrices and quaternions), but it would be great to use tf instead, as that makes all these routines nicely accessible from virtually all nodes that we want to build in ROS later.

Take a look at the bullet headers they provide all these through the btQuaternion and btMatrix3x3 classes. 

@section debugging Common Debugging Questions 

 - How can I see what transforms are in the system?

If you have an instance of TransformListener use "viewFrames.py --node=NODE_NAME" which will generate frames.pdf to see
all frames that node is aware of.  

 - I'm seeing an ExtrapolationException which is always X seconds in the past.  Why?

A constant offset extrapolation error often is caused by a lack of syncronization of the clocks between computers.  
One computer thinks it is ahead of the other and consequently the data recieved on a different machine will be off consistently.  
As new data comes in the closest data will always be the same distance away resulting in the constant ExtrapolationException.
