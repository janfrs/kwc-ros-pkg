/** Transform Reference
 * \brief A c++ library which provides coordinate transforms between any two frames in a system. 
 * 
 * This class provides a simple interface to allow recording and lookup of 
 * relationships between arbitrary frames of the system.
 * 
 * libTF assumes that there is a tree of coordinate frame transforms which define the relationship between all coordinate frames.  
 * For example your typical robot would have a transform from global to real world.  And then from base to hand, and from base to head.  
 * But Base to Hand really is composed of base to shoulder to elbow to wrist to hand.  
 * libTF is designed to take care of all the intermediate steps for you.  
 * 
 * Internal Representation 
 * libTF will store frames with the parameters necessary for generating the transform into that frame from it's parent and a reference to the parent frame.
 * Frames are designated using an unsigned int
 * There are two "special" frames 
 * 1 is the ROOT_FRAME which is the root of the tree.
 * 0 is a frame without a parent ( uninitialized, this should never be the case if you want to use it, for everything has a position in global. But if you're lazy it's possible not to be connected to ROOT_FRAME.)
 * The positions of frames over time must be pushed in.  
 * 
 *  Interface 
 * libTF has a set function that takes the parent frame number, and parameters of the coordinate transform.  
 * currently implemented you can set DH Parameters or x,y,z,yaw,pitch,roll
 * I will be adding x,y,z,quaternions
 * libTF has a get function that takes two frameIDs and returns the homogeneous transformation matrix between them.  
 *
 * It will provide interpolated positions out given a time argument.
