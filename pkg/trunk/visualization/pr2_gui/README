This package depends on wxWidgets 2.8.
On Ubuntu, install the libwxgtk2.8-dev.  On other systems, install the
appropriate package.

In order to run this package, you must also be running a botherder as well as a namelookup_server and 
a robot description file must be loaded into the parameter server.
A roslaunch script is included in this directory that will load the necessary packages with the exception of botherder.
The script will also run rosgazebo in order to provide a test for this package.
If you do not want to run rosgazebo, delete the following lines:

    <node pkg="gazebo" type="run-gazebo.sh" args="$(find gazebo_robot_description)/world/robot_rosgazebo.world" respawn="true" />
    <node pkg="pr2_gazebo" type="run-pr2_gazebo.sh" args="" respawn="true" />
