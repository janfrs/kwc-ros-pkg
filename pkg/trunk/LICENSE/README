This directory contains full license statements for all licenses that
cover code in the PersonalRobots packages.  Each package directory
contains a 'manifest.xml' file that specifies its license.  For each
license 'foo' mentioned in a manfest.xml, there is a license file
'foo.txt' in this directory.

For convenience, this directory also contains language-specific
pre-commented summary license statements for inclusion in the package
code itself.  If you are writing C/C++ code under license 'foo', then
you can simply paste the contents of 'foo-summary.c' into the top of
each of your source files.  Be sure to fill in the PACKAGE_NAME, YEAR,
and OWNER fields.
