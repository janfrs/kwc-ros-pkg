  <description>This package grabs a live audio stream from PortAudio and ships it across the ROS botnet. The program grabs the "default" audio stream. I can't speak for other distros, but on Ubuntu the default stream is settable via the GNOME "System->Preferences->Sound" box. I set the "Sound Capture" field to "ALSA" and use "alsamixer" on the command line to poke around until I get the microphone jack working. Each motherboard seems to be a little different in how the various jacks come up in ALSA.</description>
