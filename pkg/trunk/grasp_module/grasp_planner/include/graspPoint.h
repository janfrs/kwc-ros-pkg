/*!  A GraspPoint stores the information needed to grasp an object at
  a certain location.

  For the moment, we are storing this information in the form of a
  transformation matrix that aligns the gripper with the desired
  grasping location. 

  COORDINATE SYSTEM CONVENTION: here we assume that the GRIPPER
  coordinate system is as follows:

  - origin is in the middle of the empty space between the jaws

  - x axis is pointing forward (towards the object to be grasped)

  - y axis is along the axis of translation of the parallel jaws

  - z axis is the cross product of the two

  If for example grasping a TALL VERTICAL object such as a bottle,
  with the jaws on each side of it, we would have the x axis pointing
  towards the object, the y axis pointing to the left and the z axis
  pointing up. The origin would be somewhere inside the bottle,
  presumably at its centroid.

  If this is not what the gripper coordinate system should be, this
  class as well as the grasp planner need to be modified to reflect
  that.
  
  In order to perform a grasp when starting from an instance of the
  GraspPoint, the following steps have to be performed:

  1. Place the gripper at the 3D location and orientation specified by
  the GraspPoint.

  2. Close the gripper.

  3. Hope for the best.
