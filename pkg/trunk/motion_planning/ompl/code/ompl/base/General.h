   @b OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) consists of a set of motion
   planning algorithms and nothing more. There is no environment
   specification, there is no collision detection or
   visualisation. There are only motion planners. The purpose of this
   library is to be extensible and freely available. It currently only
   contains a set of kinematic sampling-based motion planners, but
   this will be extended in the near future.

   The overall structure can be observed by looking at the @b base/
   directory. There are two main components: 
   - the space information
   - the planner

   The base space information class contains only basic definitions of
   states, paths and goals. Implementations of this space information
   class may contain additional functionality. 

   A planner can be instantiated given an instance of the space
   information. The space information contains the starting states and
   goal definition. The planner reads the neccessary data from the
   space information and fills in a path for the given goal, if it
   finds one.

   @section sampling_planners Sampling-based motion planners
   
   This class of motion planners typically needs the ability to sample
   the state (configuration) space of the robot(s) planning is done
   for. To allow this, an implementation of StateValidityChecker must
   be provided. This implementation will most likely depend on a
   collision detector.
