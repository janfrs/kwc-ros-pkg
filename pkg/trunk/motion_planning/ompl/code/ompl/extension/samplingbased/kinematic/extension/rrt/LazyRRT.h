	    idea of RRT is that it samples a random state qr in the
	    state space, then finds the state qc among the previously
	    seen states that is closest to qr and expands from qc
	    towards qr, until a state qm is reached and qm is the new
	    state to be visited. The range parameter influences how
	    this qm along the path between qc and qr is chosen. qr may
	    be too far, and it may not be best to have qm = qr all the
	    time (range = 1.0 implies qm=qr. range should be less than
	    1.0). However, in a large space, it is also good to leave
	    the neighborhood of qc (range = 0.0 implies qm=qc and no
	    progress is made. rande should be larger than
	    0.0). Multiple values of this range parameter should be
	    tried until a suitable one is found. */
