This package depends on MPK, which is available as a ROS package by
checking out the Willow Garage scratch repository at:

  http://prdev/svn/scratch/MPK

Then you should append this directory to your ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  E.g.,:

  cd $HOME/code
  svn co http://prdev/svn/scratch/MPK MPK
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$HOME/code/MPK:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH

To verify that MPK can be found:

  rospack find MPK
