    SPECTACLES is a left- and right-recursive acronym for

    SPECTACLES: Pertaining to Electronic Computer-Trained Algorithms for
    Classification and Learning, Etc.; SPECTACLES

    It's just a space for me to hack around in to get a more solid
    understanding of what computer vision is really doing, rather than
    just tinkering with already-implemented algorithms which I don't really
    understand at a fundamental level.
