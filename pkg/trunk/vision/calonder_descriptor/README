Dependencies:
  - OpenCV
  - Boost (headers only for the library)
    The Makefiles assume $BOOST_ROOT is set appropriately.
    Some programs in src/test/ require Boost.ProgramOptions and
    Boost.Filesystem binary libraries.
  - GSL (could be removed)
    sudo apt-get install libgsl0 libgsl0-dev

The top-level Makefile builds libsignatures.so in lib/.

example/example.cpp shows how to detect keypoints, compute their
signatures, and match them.
