## @mainpage gmmseg
# Performs gaussian mixture segmentation, for example look at @b gmm_client.py
# Segmentation works by assuming that the object is close the center of the
# image and first initializing two Gaussians, one smaller than the other with
# the smaller Gaussian representing the object to be segmented out.
