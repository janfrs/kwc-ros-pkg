Lots in here is highly experimental and should not be counted upon to do
anything productive. At first, I wanted to have the SHARKS scanner be an actual
ROS flow graph, but I soon realized that for a tightly coupled system such as
this, that will introduce unnecessary complication and overhead. So now I am
writing "libsharks" which brings in the static library drivers for the Axis
camera and the IPDCMOT motor controller. This means that SHARKS is now tied to
a particular camera and motor controller, but the payoff in terms of simplicity
seems worth it for now.

libsharks is then used by LONESHARK which is a standalone program that grabs
scans.
