@b map_server is a ROS node that reads an occupancy grid map from an image
file and offers up the map via a ROS service.

When parsing the image, a pixel is considered to be free (occupancy
value 0) if the mean of its RGB values is greater than 0.9*255 (i.e.,
very white).  The pixel is occupied (occupancy value 100) if the mean
is less than 0.5*255 (i.e., sort of black).  Anything in between is
considered unknown (occupancy value -1).

@todo Establish a standard for storing maps, with metadata (origin,
resolution, color thresholds, etc.) in the same file.  Perhaps we can use
PNGs with comments for this purpose. Then rewrite this node to use said
standard.
