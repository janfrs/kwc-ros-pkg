   @htmlinclude manifest.html

   This library provides functionality for maintaining a 2D cost map.  The primary inputs are:
   - a priori 2-D occupancy grid map
   - 3D obstacle data
   - control parameters

   This cost map is initialized with the a priori map, and thereafter updated 
   with obstacle data.  A sliding window model of persistence is used, in which
   obstacle data lives in the map for a fixed (but configurable) amount of time
   before being discarded.  The static map lives forever. Dynamic obstacle data is filtered
   to account for the robot body, and based on a z-value threshold to permit projection of 3D
   data to the 2D plane. Control parameters dictate the sliding window length, z threshold and
   inflation radius.

   For examples of usage see the test harness.
