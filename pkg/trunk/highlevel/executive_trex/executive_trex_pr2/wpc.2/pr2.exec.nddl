 * This is a test of correct recall behavior. A single navigation goal is constrained to have a very short duration.
 * The goal will be dispatched and pursued but the plan will break when the expected observation for completion does not appear.
 * The expected result is to recall the goal, causing the robot to stop. The goal will be rejected.
