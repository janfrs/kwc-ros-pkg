<description brief='Contains high-level controllers which receive goals and generate state updates on goal achievement. These controllers
		    represent an encapsulated task that leverages underlying system components, including real-time controllers, to achieve
		    a given goal. All such controllers can be tasked with a goal, will report state periodically, can have a goal recalled,
		    and operate with general semantics of being active or inactive.'>
