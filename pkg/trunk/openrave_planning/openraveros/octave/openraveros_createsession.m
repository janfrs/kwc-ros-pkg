%% session = openraveros_createsession(sessionserver, cloneuuid)
%
%% creates a session and returns its id.
%% clonesession (optional) - if passed in, will clone the new session with this session
%% the environment id that uniquely determines a session is passed in the uuid
%% Output:
%% session.id - local identifier used to make session calls or session terminations
%% session.uuid - unique identifier for the session server across the entire ROS network
%% session.server - name of the session server
